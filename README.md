Add terrainFlattener.sqf to a scripts folder in your mission. 
Add the line [this] execVM "scripts\terrainFlattener.sqf"; to the Init field of the vehicle you want to use.
When in the driver's seat in-game you should have an option to set the flattening altitude and one to toggle on flattening. 
If using the Bobcat vehicle the plough will also move up and down when turning the function on and off.
